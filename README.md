VULNS:
- grub config: grub superusers

- lightdm stuff- make it so that guest users can have uid below 1000

- group access control stuff (getfacl, all that stuff in terms of who owns and has permissions for stuff)

- ssh- key only 
- make service that does bad things 
- cronjobs galore in /etc/skel and make them create users,

- bad media extensions:

- nologin shell stuff

- hopefully they have to priv esc to even fix some stuff

- configuring a mail server 

- key logger running in background
FORENSICS:
- use john to crack a blowfish hash

- applying automatic updates thru the GUI update manager
